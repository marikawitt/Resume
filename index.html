        <h4>Summer 2017</h4>
        <p>Did some math research. Yes, a bit nerdy but fun! Spent a summer in Rochester, NY doing research with my partner from Colorado School of Mines about complete bipartite graphs and their L(h,k) labelings. Trying to fill this space with more words. Three lines is enough, no? Or should I just write a really, really, really, really, really long sentence to make sure we get to a fourth? Yup, tha'ts what just happened.</p>
